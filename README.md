# git_practice
The practice repository that was created when the Git_book was written. 

This repository was created locally and has lived in remotes associated with two personal accounts. The version you find in the ADF&G-DSF account represents the version pushed to the organizational remote in the "Before you go!" chapter. Notice that this version tracks the changes associated with each pull request completed in its history but lack the GitHub specific features where the repository owner and the person requesting the pull request communicated about those changes.
